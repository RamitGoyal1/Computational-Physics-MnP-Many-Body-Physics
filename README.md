## Project Description
This repository serves as a comprehensive portfolio of my work during the **Many Body Physics project** organized by the **Math and Physics Club (MnP), IIT Bombay**.

The primary goal is to study **Phase Transitions** and **Critical Phenomena** in disordered systems using numerical techniques. Starting from geometric models like Percolation, the project expands into thermodynamic systems (like the Ising Model), employing **Monte Carlo simulations** and **Finite Size Scaling** analysis to understand macroscopic behaviors from microscopic rules.
